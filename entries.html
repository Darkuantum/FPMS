						<p class="pEntry">Entry #1 - 5th October 2019 - 1728h <br>
						
						This is my first entry on the website that I have created. From now on,
						instead of making reports in Word, I will do it here.<br>I will have to upgrade
						the website slowly because right now it does not look very good. <br><br>
						I think I will use this website project for the NYAA Gold skills development part.
						Putting in about 1 to 2 hours per week might be a good start.</p>

						I will keep this entry page to keep my thoughts during these times, but will
						also make a page to log everything productive I do so that in the future I can
						track my productivity.</p>

						I have given more colors to my webpage and have formatted the elements in my webpage better
						using the new HTML tags that I have learned today.</p>

						Today I have learned how to implement simple JavaScript inside my website, and I am able
						to implement some simple functions. However when trying to implement more complex functions
						my hands were tied.</p>

						I have upgraded the look of the website to be easier to read, but I think the color will
						still change in the future. I just learned yesterday that I was not selected for the SP
						Engineering Scholars so that hurt a bit, however the opportunities available by SPOT
						program are still open.</p>

						Yesterday, I have just completed the Best Coders 2019 Hackathon with my team members.
						I have managed to learn a bit of Python and the library for Pandas which deals with a
						type of data called dataframes. <br>
						On another note, I will make this my last hackathon of the year since this year I have already
						participated in 7 Hackathons. For now, I will focus on learning and gathering information to try
						and start a business.</p>

						I have recently watched a TED Talk about how game theory can teach us things about war. Notably,
						that there are two types of games: infinite and finite games. Those that play the same
						type of game have a stable match, but those who are playing a game the infinite way will always win against
						those who play it finite. </br>
						The speaker has also stated how this can affect businesses. Those who see the infinite game, in other
						words they have a vision, succeed while those who try to attain a finite goal rarely do. </br>
						Hence I should try to shape my goals with this in mind, and make it my mission statement.</p>

						I have thought of my mission statement, which aligns with my goal of seeing a Type I civilization
						in my lifetime and bringing all the cool advanced technologies to people. However it might not tackle
						international problems yet. I might need to create a second brand with an another mission statement and
						make it my secondary objective.</p>

						<p class="pEntry"> Entry #9 - 3nd November 2019 - 1710h <br>
						
						Last Friday, 1st of November 2019, we just had the 10th anniversary for my course, Engineering with Business
						and I had the opportunity to connect with my seniors and alumni who came for the event.<br>
						Firstly, I learned that to start a business, you must want to solve a problem, because wanting to start a
						business is not enough to bring you through the gruesome stages of a startup. Hence I should focus on learning
						about the things around me and find some problems to solve, which works for me as this was what I originally
						wanted to do. I was going about it the wrong way, because I wanted money for the projects I wanted to do.<br>
						Secondly, I talked to my alumni about SUTD, and it seems like a very appealing school with a lot of freedom.
						They also do research and you can become an assistant to professors researching there.</p>
