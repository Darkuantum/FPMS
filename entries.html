						<p>Entry #1 - 5th October 2019 - 1728h <br>
						
						This is my first entry on the website that I have created. From now on,
						instead of making reports in Word, I will do it here.<br>I will have to upgrade
						the website slowly because right now it does not look very good. <br><br>
						I think I will use this website project for the NYAA Gold skills development part.
						Putting in about 1 to 2 hours per week might be a good start.</p>

					<p> Entry #2 - 7th October 2019 - 2037h <br>
					
					I will keep this entry page to keep my thoughts during these times, but will
					also make a page to log everything productive I do so that in the future I can
					track my productivity.</p>

					<p> Entry #3 - 9th October 2019 - 0155h <br>
					
					I have given more colors to my webpage and have formatted the elements in my webpage better
					using the new HTML tags that I have learned today.</p>

					<p> Entry #4 - 10th October 2019 - 0030h <br>
					
					Today I have learned how to implement simple JavaScript inside my website, and I am able
					to implement some simple functions. However when trying to implement more complex functions
					my hands were tied.</p>

					<p> Entry #5 - 15th October 2019 - 1217h <br>
					
					I have upgraded the look of the website to be easier to read, but I think the color will
					still change in the future. I just learned yesterday that I was not selected for the SP
					Engineering Scholars so that hurt a bit, however the opportunities available by SPOT
					program are still open.</p>
